## Virtual Patient Clinic

Patients get a url for virtual appointment with which they are connected to the clinic operator.  The clinic operator sees all patients with their doctor to be seen and can then connect a patient to the doctor.

Prior to connecting a patient to a doctor the communication is done via socket.io, without Circuit involvement. Once the operator connects the patient with a doctor, the patient make use of Circuit's guest feature. A bot is monitoring the calls which is how the operators console is kept up to date.

Future enhancements:

 - Socket.io messaging between operator and patient, prior to connecting to doctor
 - Provide patient dial in number in addition to url
 - Circuit integration into the operator console so that operator can easily communicate with doctors
